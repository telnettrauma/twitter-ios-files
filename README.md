This is a repository that I created to make it easier to analyze the files from the iOS version of the Twitter app. This project is created not necessarily as an archive, but rather as a way to keep track of changes between different versions.

Files are from the [IPA Archive](https://ipaarchive.com/app/usa/333903271), so they may contain extra things added by that. However, it should still have everything.

# Interesting Files

These are the files that are most likely to contain the most interesting information

- [fs_embedded_defaults_production.json](https://github.com/makeamovie/twitter-ios-files/blob/main/fs_embedded_defaults_production.json) - contains all the flags (feature experiments) in the app ([iPad Version](https://github.com/makeamovie/twitter-ios-files/blob/main/fs_embedded_defaults_ipad_production.json))
- [Localizable.strings](https://github.com/makeamovie/twitter-ios-files/blob/main/Localization_Localization.bundle/en.lproj/Localizable.strings) - all of the text strings in the app in English (note that some strings may be server side)
