/* A template for specifying the separator between the next to last and the last names in a list of three or more names. (Lists of two names are commonly formatted specially and will be translated using FULL_NAME_LIST_OF_TWO_FORMAT rather than this string.) This string, when combined with FULL_NAME_LIST_START_FORMAT and FULL_NAME_LIST_MIDDLE_FORMAT, allows for more natural translation in the many languages that have special formatting for the first two or last two names in a list. For example, in the English list "Sara, John, LaToya, Julie, Kristen, Dwayne, and Lucy", the separator between Sara and John is controlled by FULL_NAME_LIST_START_FORMAT, the separator between Dwayne and Lucy is controlled by this string, and the separators between all other names are controlled by FULL_NAME_LIST_MIDDLE_FORMAT. If your language does not have special formatting for the first or last separators in a list feel free to make all three strings the same. Finally, If your language requires specific formatting for names when they are presented in a list, specify that via FULL_NAME_LIST_ITEM_FORMAT.
